    "If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And If it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first." ~ M Twain
  - "If people like Juliana can do it, fuck, so can I!"
  - "Activation energy: you either have it or you don't. If you do, work, if not, do relax. There's nothing in between."
  - "Always prepare in advance! If you're not prepared, you can just as well stay in bed."
  - "Clean up after yourself as you go. It goes for your notebook as well."
  - "You're awesome!"
  - "Am I being productive or just active?"
  - "Parkinson's Law: A task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion."
