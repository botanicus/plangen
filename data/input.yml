  - "If people like Juliana can do it, fuck, so can I!"

  - "Always prepare in advance! If you're not prepared, you can just as well stay in bed."
  - "Clean up after yourself as you go. It goes for your notebook as well."
  - "You're awesome!"
  - "Am I being productive or just active?"
  - "Parkinson's Law: A task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion."
