  "If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And If it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first." ~ M Twain
- If people like Juliana can do it, fuck, so can I!
- Don't work for work's sake!
- Always prepare in advance! If you're not prepared, you can just as well stay in bed.
- Clean up after yourself as you go. It goes for your notebook as well.
- You're awesome!
